## About

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

## Getting started

You will find a **.bas file** with the script for this challenge, as well as, a folder with **9 screenshots**(6 for Alpabetical_Testing and 3 for Multiple_year_stock), a folder with **2 excel files**, and a **README file**

## Installing

1) To get started, use the sheet ***alphabetical_testing.xlsx***. 
2) From there open the .bas file and run the code.
3) Run the code.
